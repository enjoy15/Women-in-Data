Select one or more choices from the list of common Machine Learning Algorithms, do some investigations and write me a short summary. I am looking for the following: 

•	Select -> Linear Regression 

•	Is it Supervised/Unsupervised/Reinforcement learning? 
Linear Regression is supervised learning.

•	What does the algorithm do? 
It finds the correlations between dependent and independent variables. It helps predict the continuous variables such as price, salary, age.

•	In which situations will it be most useful? 
Predicting continuous values such as Market Trends or House prices.

•	(Optional) Can you find any examples of where this algorithm has been used? 
Understand the relationship between advertising spending and revenue.
understand the relationship between drug dosage and blood pressure of patients.
